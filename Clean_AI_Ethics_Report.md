Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed various sectors, including healthcare, where it holds the potential to transform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. However, its integration into medical settings brings significant ethical challenges that need careful consideration. This paper examines the current state of AI in healthcare, focusing on five critical ethical concerns: justice and fairness, transparency, patient consent and confidentiality, accountability, and [...] 1.  Accountability is a key ethical concern in healthcare AI, defining responsibility for AI-driven decisions in patient care. Unlike traditional medicine, where clinicians are accountable, AI involves multiple stakeholders, including developers, providers, and institutions. Errors or unsafe recommendations complicate accountability, especially when AI systems are opaque or lack documentation. Without clear accountability, patient safety risks increase, and trust erodes. Robust frameworks are [...] The rapid advancement of AI and machine learning in healthcare presents significant challenges in maintaining ethical standards and regulatory oversight. Key concerns include fairness, transparency, consent, accountability, and equitable care, yet addressing these issues is difficult as understanding AI models often comes through their implementation. Bias remains one of the most pressing issues, particularly due to the lack of standardization in industry regulations and review processes.

Summary: The use of AI in healthcare raises concerns about inaccuracy and data breach possibilities. The use of electronic health records (EHRs) can be used for scientific studies, improving the quality of healthcare and clinical care optimization, however, this comes with a risk of data being hacked and shared for the wrong purposes. Other ethical considerations include the ownership of an individual’s healthcare records and patient history, who this will be shared with and when, and if consent needs [...] The ethical issues with artificial intelligence in healthcare revolve around privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, as well as the role of human judgement. Where there is technology, there is always a risk of inaccuracy and data breaches. And, mistakes in healthcare can have devastating consequences for patients. Because there are no well-defined regulations on the legal and ethical issues relating to artificial intelligence and the role it plays in healthcare, this is a crucial

Summary: With growing evidence of bias in the development and implementation of AI-based prediction models, identifying and mitigating the sources of bias in each step is critical. However, our current understanding of bias in AI reflects no more than the tip of the iceberg. To ensure that AI technology and tools achieve their full potential of improving healthcare rather than being a source for further disparities, stakeholders, including clinicians, AI researchers, patient advocacy groups, health [...] There are also other sources of bias that we may not be aware of. Furthermore, most of the identified sources of bias reflect those seen in developed countries, mostly North America and Europe. Our understanding of potential sources of bias in global healthcare is limited. Therefore, the development of an AI algorithm requires a diverse team that incorporates members from various disciplines, genders, racial/ethnic groups, as well as representation from various geographical regions and cultural [...] While evaluating diverse sources of bias in AI algorithms is an important first step, it is essential that we identify strategies to mitigate bias during the development, validation, dissemination, and implementation of algorithms. A number of comprehensive frameworks and checklists have been developed, such as the Translational Evaluation of Healthcare AI (TEHAI) \[[46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10287014/#pdig.0000278.ref046)\], the DECIDE-AI

Such frameworks aim to systematically identify and mitigate bias to ensure that AI models adhere to ethical principles and [...] Central to these challenges is the issue of bias, which can manifest itself in numerous forms to exacerbate existing healthcare disparities. Regulatory bodies, including the European Commission, FDA, Health Canada, the World Health Organization (WHO), have intensified their efforts to establish stricter frameworks for the development and deployment of AI in healthcare, recognizing a critical need to uphold the core principles of fairness, equity, and [...] (Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 2022)."). Moreover, there is a critical need to integrate AI and machine learning content into medical training curricula. This will prepare healthcare professionals for a future where data-driven decision-making is increasingly considered the standard of care. Understanding AI, its potential biases, and ethical implications will therefore be crucial for these individuals to appropriately contribute to its refinement and

Question 3: **What are the ethical boundaries of AI autonomy in medical decision-making, particularly in situations where AI recommendations conflict with clinician judgment or patient preferences, and how can we establish clear lines of responsibility and accountability?** This question explores the delicate balance between AI's capabilities and human oversight.  It's crucial to define the appropriate level of AI autonomy, establish protocols for resolving conflicts, and determine who is ultimately responsible when AI-driven decisions lead to adverse outcomes

Summary: Additionally, **accountability** is a major concern in AI development. When an AI system makes a harmful or biased decision, it is crucial to determine who is responsible. Is it the developers who built the system, the organizations that deployed it, or the individuals who use it? Clear guidelines on accountability are necessary to ensure that AI developers and users are held responsible for the outcomes of AI decisions. [...] Another important ethical dilemma concerns accountability. When AI makes decisions that result in harmful or significant consequences, who should bear the responsibility? Is it going to be the developer, user, or AI itself? This question has become even more complicated by automated systems that operate with minimal human intervention.

#### Legal Implications of AI Actions [...] Finally, **accountability** in AI decision-making is another ethical issue that cannot be overlooked. When an AI system makes an erroneous or harmful decision, who is responsible? Is it the developers who built the system, the users who deployed it, or the AI system itself? Establishing clear guidelines for accountability is essential to ensure that AI systems are held to high ethical standards and that individuals harmed by AI decisions can seek justice.
