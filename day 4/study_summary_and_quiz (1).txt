üìö Summary:
Okay, here's a summarized version of the prompt engineering study material:

**I. Introduction to Prompt Engineering**

*   **What are Prompts?** Instructions and context given to a language model (LM) to achieve a specific task.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use LMs for various applications. It's a valuable skill for AI engineers and researchers.
*   **Why Prompt Engineering?**
    *   Important for research, discoveries, and advancements in AI.
    *   Helps test and evaluate the limitations of LLMs.
    *   Enables innovative applications on top of LLMs.

**II. Basic Prompt Elements & Settings**

*   **Prompt Components:**
    *   Instructions
    *   Context
    *   Input Data
    *   Output Indicator
*   **Important Settings:** Controlling how deterministic the model is.
    *   **Temperature:** (0-1) Controls randomness.  Low = predictable, high = diverse.
    *   **Top_p:** Selects a set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p. Low = repetitive, high = diverse.
*   **Different settings** can produce vastly different results.

**III. Designing Prompts for Different Tasks**

*   **Common Tasks:**
    *   Text Summarization (provide context and instruction to summarize)
    *   Question Answering (provide context and ask a question related to the context, instruct the model to respond briefly or indicate if it is unsure)
    *   Text Classification (provide text and ask to classify it)
    *   Role Playing (set the scene with the character and instruct the model to respond in character)
    *   Code Generation (instruction to generate certain code)
    *   Reasoning (ask to provide logic and explanation to the answer, and provide instruction on how to step through the process)

**IV. Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques**

*   **Few-shot Prompts:**  Provide examples in the prompt to guide the model's performance.
*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Instruct the model to reason step-by-step in its response.
*   **Zero-Shot CoT:** Adding "Let's think step by step" to the original prompt.
*   **Self-Consistency:** Generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most consistent answer to improve CoT prompting.
*   **Generate Knowledge Prompting:** Provide additional, model-generated knowledge as part of the context.
*   **Program-Aided Language Models (PAL):** Use an LLM to generate programs as reasoning steps, offloading solutions to a runtime (e.g., Python interpreter).
*   **ReAct:** Interleave reasoning traces and task-specific actions.  Enables interaction with external tools and knowledge sources.
*   **Directional Stimulus Prompting:** A tuneable policy LM is trained to generate hints that guide a black box frozen LLM

**V. Risks**

*   **Prompt Injection:** Hijacking an LM's output by injecting untrusted commands that override instructions.
*   **Prompt Leaking:** Forcing the model to reveal information about its prompt, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **Jailbreaking:** Bypassing safety and moderation features of LLMs using harmful prompts.
